## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r read_excel}
Jurczak <- read_excel("/Volumes/DISK_IMG/Jake/qPCR/2022-09-12_175355_BWAT_Gdf15.xls", range ="Results!A36:K132")
summary(Jurczak)``
#range "Results!" is to specify which sheet.
#I also used import data set under file. 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r , echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
