# Title: GDF15 emerging biology and therapeutic applications for obesity and cardiometabolic disease
# Abstract
 * TGF$\beta$ superfamily
 * stress, exercise, and metformin lead to increase in GDF15
 * GDF15 & GFRAL are independent of other appetite hormones

# Introduction
  * Obesity-->NAFLD & Insulin Resistance--> T2DM
  * GDF15
    + ~25 kDa homodimer
    + 112 AA w Disulfide linkage
  * Expressed
    + Liver, Intestine, Kidney, and placenta
  * GDF15 increase in obesity
  * GDF15 inversely related with body mass in nonobese peeps
  * GDF15 is not causing obesity but rather Increased levels of GDf15 are a consequence of obesity. 
  * GDF15 levels are at `r plasmaMin` to `r plasmaMax` (ng/mL)
    + GDF15 old mice have 0.25 ng/mL
    + GDF15 young mice have 0.17 ng/mL

### Tissue Expression
 * *Gdf15 is expressed in healthy mice in the following order: Kidney>Liver>WAT>BAT>skeletal muscle*
* *Gdf15 is expressed in Obese mice in the following order: Liver>WAT>BAT get to levels in the kidney*
